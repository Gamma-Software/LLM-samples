The website provided information about a nanny agency that offers a holistic approach to childcare, focusing on emotional well-being and alternative approaches such as Montessori and Steiner nannies. Testimonials praised the agency for finding nannies with a gentle approach based on knowledge of development and neuroscience. The agency also offers a referral program and contact information for the USA, UK, and worldwide. I also received human feedback that the agency is more focused on USA and England nannies and that Cergy is located in France.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"google\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"Montessori nannies in Cergy with availability starting from December 4th\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command google returned: [\\n    {\\n        \"title\": \"Nannies in Cergy | Babysits\",\\n        \"href\": \"https://en.babysits.fr/nanny/cergy/\",\\n        \"body\": \"Nanny in Cergy wanted?
