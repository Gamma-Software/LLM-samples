"I received a command to browse the website alternativenannies.com to learn about their experience and pedagogical approach. The website provided information about a nanny agency that offers a holistic approach to childcare, focusing on emotional well-being and alternative approaches such as Montessori and Steiner nannies. Testimonials praised the agency for finding nannies with a gentle approach based on knowledge of development and neuroscience. The agency also offers a referral program and contact information for the USA, UK, and worldwide. I also received human feedback that the agency is more focused on USA and England nannies and that Cergy is located in France."
